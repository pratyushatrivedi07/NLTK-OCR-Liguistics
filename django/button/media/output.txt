1, The CIA Triad

Confidentiality : Confidentiality means keeping things hidden. One particular method of
confidentiality that you probably use everyday is password protection. For
confidentiality to work, you need to limit access to your data. Only those who
absolutely need to know how to gain access, should.

Integrity : Integrity means keeping our data accurate and untampered with. The data
that we send or receive should remain the same throughout its entire journey.
Availability : Availability means that the information we have is readily accessible to
the people that should have it.

   

* Every aspect of security revolves around these three key principles: Confidentiality,
Integrity and Availability.

2. Essential Security Terms

Risk : The possibility of suffering a loss in the event of an attack on the system.
Vulnerability : A flaw in the system that could be exploited to compromise the
system. Vulnerabilities can be holes that you may or may not be aware of.

- Eg: When you're writing a web app and enable a de-bug account for

testing during development but forget to disable it before launching the app. You

now have a vulnerability in your app that an attacker can potentially discover.

* There's a special type of vulnerability called 0-day Vulnerability or 0-day

 

0-day Vulnerability : It is a vulnerability that is not known to the software developer
or vendor, but is known to an attacker. The name refers to the amount of time the
software vendor has to react and to fix the vulnerability i.e. zero days.

Exploit : Software that is used to take advantage of a security bug or vulnerability.
Attackers will write up exploits for vulnerabilities they find in software to cause harm
to the system.
- Eg :- Let's say the attacker discovers a zero day vulnerability. She decides to
take advantage of the previously unknown bug and writes a zero day exploit
code. That code will specifically target and take advantage of this unknown bug
to gain access and cause damage to the systems.
